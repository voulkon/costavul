#### Project Details

A brief examination of the data issued by the Public Health Authority in Greece, regarding the positions occupied in Intensive Care Units.

The only factor examined is whether patients were vaccinated or not.

Results indicate that the majority of patients in Intensive Care Units are unvaccinated.

You can find a light version (with static plots) of the analysis [here](https://voulkon.github.io/ICU_positions_by_-un-vaccinated_in_Greece/Vax-in-Greece%20-%20Static.html).
