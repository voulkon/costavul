    <p class="lead">
    The thrill of solving and nerd spirit brought me into the data world.
    <br>
    An economist by training, a data engineer by vocation, I started my career as an assistant Tax Auditor (15 months) and then continued with developing Data Products & Solutions. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>So far, I have worked with Deloitte Greece to lighten our clients' workload through automation and develop new data services and products</strong>.
    <br>
    As an open-source enthusiast, I like developing code in my spare time and share it freely with the community. 
    <br>
    Splitting my calendar year between Athens and my home island of Lemnos has enabled me to exercise my interests in Art & Gardening.
